    "\n",
    "**Requirement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Design two classes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Create a class called **PlayingCard**. This class should have: <br>\n",
    "- An attribute, \"rank\" that takes a value of \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"10\", \"J\", \"Q\", \"K\", or \"A\"<br>\n",
    "- An attribute, \"suit\" that takes a value of \"♠\" \"♥\" \"♦\" or \"♣\". (If you don't know how to make these characters you can cut and paste from this block)<br>  \n",
    "- An __init__ function that:\n",
    "    -  Accepts as parameters a specific rank (as a string) and suit (as a string).\n",
    "    -  Gives an appropriate response when a rank or suit is not valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Create a class called **Deck**.  This class should have: <br>\n",
    "- An attribute, \"cards\", that holds a list of PlayingCard objects. <br>\n",
    "- An __init__ function that: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - By default stores a full deck of 52 playing card (with proper numbers and suits) in the \"cards\" list. Each cards will be  of the class PlayingCard above<br>\n",
    "    - Allows the user to specify a specific suit (of the 4 - \"♠\" \"♥\" \"♦\" or \"♣\").  In this case, the program should only populate the deck with the 13 cards of that suit.\n",
    "    - After the cards object is initialized, call the \"shuffle_deck()\" function (below).<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "- A \"shuffle_deck()\" function that randomly changes the order of cards in the deck.<br>\n",
    "    - You can import the random library to 'shuffle' the deck: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/random.html\n",
    "    - If you import random, please import it at the top of your block instead of inside the class / methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A \"deal_card(card_count)\" function that removes the first card_count cards from the deck and returns them as a list.<br>\n",
    "    - Make sure this function gives an appropriate response when the deck is out of cards.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3\\. We may have to write ```__str__ or __repr__``` methods to display the cards correctly in either or both classes.\n",
    "\n",
